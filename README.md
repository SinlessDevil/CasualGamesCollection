# Chain Cube 2048 
is an addictive merge puzzle game for those who like challenging brain teasers and logic puzzle merge games. Believe, it is much harder to reach 2048 than drop the number.

A whole new take on the famous brain teaser number game! Now in 3D with crazy fun physics! Cubes don't stay in place — they fall realistically and bounce off each other if you haven’t managed to merge cube number blocks!
